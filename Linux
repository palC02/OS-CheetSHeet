!foo -> Run the previous command starting with foo
!foo:p -> Print the previous command starting with foo
!!:s/f­oo/bar -> Substitute foo with bar within the previous command
^foo^bar -> Same as above, runs the previous command replacing foo with bar
!comm:­s/f­oo/bar -> This will search for commands starting with comm, replace foo with bar and execute the command. Can be appended with :p to print out the command before running
!n -> Will run command n in the history, replace with whatever number you want from the output of the history command. !1 will run the first command. !-1 will run the previous command, same as !!
$_  -> Variable for the last argument in the previous command.
